  <div class="container">
    <h2>💼 Step 1: Invest in Stocks or Mutual Funds</h2>
    <p>Put your money to work by investing in the stock market or mutual funds. Over time, these can generate returns through dividends and capital appreciation.</p>

    <h2>🏠 Step 2: Real Estate Income</h2>
    <p>Buy property and earn rental income. Real estate is a long-term investment that can also appreciate in value.</p>

    <h2>📈 Step 3: Fixed Deposits & Bonds</h2>
    <p>Low-risk options like FDs and government bonds offer steady interest income. Great for preserving capital while earning modest returns.</p>

    <h2>🛍️ Step 4: Start a Reselling Business</h2>
    <p>Use your money to buy products in bulk and resell them online at a profit. Platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho make this easy.</p>

    <h2>🔗 Step 5: Affiliate Marketing</h2>
    <p>Invest in a blog or website and promote products. Earn commissions when people buy through your links. It’s a passive income stream once set up.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Step 6: Upskill and Monetize Knowledge</h2>
    <p>Spend money on learning new skills (coding, design, marketing), then offer services or create digital products like eBooks or courses.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Bonus Tip: Reinvest Your Profits</h2>
    <p>Don’t just spend your earnings—reinvest them into new ventures, better tools, or higher-yield opportunities. That’s how wealth grows.</p>

    <p><em>Money is a tool. Use it wisely, and it will work for you—even while you sleep.</em></p>
